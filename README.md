# Portfolio

## Description

This application is my portfolio recreated in React.js. Using this JavaScript framework, I refactored a previously HTML based application into one done only in JavaScript and CSS. Included is a "Contact Me" page as well as a place to download my resume.

## Usage

Once you open up the application, you can click on any of the navigation items to take you to that respective page. Once you navigate to "Portfolio" you will be presented with a list of some of my projects which includes the repo they are located in as well as a link to the deployed application. When you navigate to "Contact", a form is provided for you to contact me. Clicking on the "Resume" item directs you to where you can download a copy of my resume.
